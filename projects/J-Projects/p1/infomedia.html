                <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong>BR ( 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) 
                was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the <b>11  <sup>th</sup></b> 
                president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and 
                studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and 
                science administrator, mainly at the <i>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                <b>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</i></b> and was intimately involved in India's civilian 
                space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man 
                of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also 
                played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests 
                in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<sup>[1]</sup>

                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of
                Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father 
                Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited 
                Dhanushkodi.

                Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] 
                While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress 
                and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. 
                Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress 
                and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, 
                as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.<sup>[1]</sup>

                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, 
                Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). 
                He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] 
                Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and 
                recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] 
                In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite 
                Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had 
                first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's
                approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.<sup>[1]</sup>
